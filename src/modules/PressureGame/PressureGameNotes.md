BJJ × D&D-style combat model, where the belt level = DC to resist and the attacker’s modifier = skill advantage.

We’ll treat the attack modifier as a shorthand for:
“How much refined technique, timing, and adaptation the practitioner can apply in a live exchange.”

A) attack modifiers and DCs for each BJJ belt level:

| **BJJ Belt**                    | **Attack Modifier** | **DC (Difficulty Class)** | **Approx. D&D Difficulty Tier** | **Narrative Meaning**                                                                           |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🥋 **White Belt**               | **+2**              | **10**                    | *Easy*                          | Instinctive, unrefined—relies on strength, not timing.                                          |
| 🟦 **Blue Belt**                | **+4**              | **13**                    | *Moderate*                      | Understands structure and base; can execute simple sequences reliably.                          |
| 🟪 **Purple Belt**              | **+6**              | **15**                    | *Challenging*                   | Begins anticipating opponents; uses chained attacks effectively.                                |
| 🟫 **Brown Belt**               | **+8**              | **17**                    | *Hard*                          | Expert-level control, sharp grip sequences, anticipates reactions.                              |
| ⬛ **Black Belt**                | **+10**             | **20**                    | *Very Hard*                     | Mastery of leverage, tempo, and efficiency; rarely makes mistakes.                              |
| 🥇 **Competitor Black (Elite)** | **+12 to +14**      | **23–25**                 | *Legendary / Nearly Impossible* | Combines mastery, adaptability, and strategic deception; success demands precision or surprise. |


B) 2×2 (expanded to full) Matrix — Required d20 to Hit
| **Attacker ↓ / Defender →** | **White (DC 10)** | **Blue (DC 13)** | **Purple (DC 15)** | **Brown (DC 17)** | **Black (DC 20)** |
| --------------------------- | ----------------- | ---------------- | ------------------ | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| 🥋 **White (+2)**           | 8 to hit          | 11 to hit        | 13 to hit          | 15 to hit         | 18 to hit         |
| 🟦 **Blue (+4)**            | 6 to hit          | 9 to hit         | 11 to hit          | 13 to hit         | 16 to hit         |
| 🟪 **Purple (+6)**          | 4 to hit          | 7 to hit         | 9 to hit           | 11 to hit         | 14 to hit         |
| 🟫 **Brown (+8)**           | 2 to hit          | 5 to hit         | 7 to hit           | 9 to hit          | 12 to hit         |
| ⬛ **Black (+10)**           | *Auto (hit ≥ 2)*  | 3 to hit         | 5 to hit           | 7 to hit          | 10 to hit         |

Reading the Matrix

Each number = minimum d20 roll required (before modifiers).

Lower numbers mean a much higher chance to succeed.

Example:

A Purple Belt needs a 9 or higher on d20 to pass/sweep another Purple Belt (~60% success).

A Black Belt needs 10 to succeed against another Black Belt (50% success).

A White Belt needs 18 vs a Black Belt (15% success).
